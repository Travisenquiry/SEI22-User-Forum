Technologies used
Ruby on Rails - The back-end framework for the project.

Reactjs - The front-end framework for the project

Materialize - Main CSS framework used to design the whole application.

Javascript - Used for DOM manipulation and materialize animation purposes.

HTML - Used to show and display the pages

Cloudinary - Used for the function of dynamic images cloud uploading onto the application.

PostgresSQL - Database used for storing user data.

Approach taken
I started with coming up many different ideas in order to satisfy the project's requirement. Upon coming up with one, I immediately went on to create the ERD and wireframe for the project and submitted for approval.

After getting the approval, I went on to create a barebone version of the website with minimalistic design before proceeding on to design on the CSS at the last part.

Installation Instructions
1. bundle install
2. yarn install

User Stories
The user will want to be able to create a main topic post into the application, so that they can share their thoughts on it or to share pictures for other to see.

The user will want to be able to comment on a created topic post, so that they can share their opinion on the topic itself.

The user will want to be able to create communities, so that they create posts that are related to the community they have created.

The user will want to be able to filter the topics by community, so that they can view only the topics that they are interested in.

Major Hurdles
One of the major hurdle I have faced is that Ruby on Rails does not play nice with React at all in terms of the database. The magic from Ruby on Rails does not work with React, and you have to go through a tedious way just to grab a joint table data. This has caused me to waste so much time and I ended up having to cut some functions off due to the time limitation to complete the project on time.
